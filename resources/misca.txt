The Boxcar Children.
A box that is conscious and wishes it weren't a box.
A world without boxes.
Deregulating the mortgage market.
Liking big butts and not being able to lie about it.
Stabbing the shit out of a Capri Sun.
Sucking the President's dick.
The Y2K bug.
Yelling "girl power!" and doing a high kick.
Being Canadian.
Clearing a bloody path through Walmart with a scimitar.
The Star Wars Holiday Special.
The shittier, Jewish version of Christmas.
These low, low prices!
Casting Magic Missile at a bully.
